# Paper Implementations

This repository provides a from-scratch implementation of the Transformer model (as described in the `"Attention is All You Need"` paper) and Vision Transformer model (known from a paper called: `AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS:TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE`), using `PyTorch`. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the complexities of the Transformer architecture in a variety of domains, including natural language processing and computer vision, by providing clean, well-documented, and easy-to-follow code implementations.

## Repository Files Structure 

 In this repo Transformer is constructed in a layered approach, starting from the fundamental building blocks and assembling them into the complete architecture.
