# Transformer Implementation using PyTorch (Attention is All You Need)

This repository provides a from-scratch implementation of the Transformer model, as described in the `"Attention is All You Need"` paper, using `PyTorch`. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the complexities of the Transformer architecture and its components.


## Transformer Architecture

## Repository Structure

 In this repo Transformer is constructed in a layered approach, starting from the fundamental building blocks and assembling them into the complete architecture.
